# Automation Project

The project aims to gain insights about the jobs posted on LinkedIn. Data is scraped automatically for 250 jobs from the LinkedIn jobs page for specific profile with a location filter. The scraping is done using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. 
This extracts relevant data, such as 'job title', 'company name', 'seniority-level', 'location' and other relevant info about the job description.
Exploratory Data Analysis such as location-based analysis, role and skill correlation matrix can give more insights about the relevant job profiles for students and assist in improving placement outcomes.
